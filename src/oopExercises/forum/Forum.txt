What is the difference between "tear" and "tear off"?
<!>
Ivan Petrov
What is the difference between "tear" and "tear off"? Can anyone help? If they have same meaning why is one written with a preposition but the other without?
<!>
Preslava Ivanova
To tear something is to pull that thing apart. The verb does not specify how much has been torn. I can take a piece of paper and tear a tiny nick in the top of it, and I still use the word "tear" for this action. In this case, the paper is still one piece, it just has a bit of damage at the top. To tear off something does not have this ambiguity. The preposition off means that one part of the object has been completely removed and is separate from the rest of the object.

Didn't have vs hadn't

I have a sentence in an exam that says: "I would come if I didn't have other plans". Is it right to say the sentence: "I would come if I HADN'T other plans".
<!>
Preslava Ivanova
Both mean the same, although didn't have is more natural in modern English.

[1] and [2] are both grammatically OK and have the same meaning, though [1] is far more likely. The difference is grammatical: in [1] "have" is a lexical verb while in [2] it's an auxiliary verb.

"substantive + more" instead of "more + substantive"

Could I say: "I couldn't give her love and attention more than I did." instead of: "I couldn't give her more love and attention than I did."?
<!>
Preslava Ivanova
Yes, you can. Both are grammatically correct: In the first sentence (your revision), the adverb "more" modifies the verb "give". In the second sentence (the original), the adjective "more" modifies the nominal phrase "love and attention". The meanings are slightly different. I think that most people would prefer the second (original) sentence, but the difference in meaning is actually quite minor.

Using "nakedly" instead of "with nothing on"
<!>
Milena Todorova
I need to know whether it is possible to substitute the following bold part with the adveb "nakedly" in a manner that it doesn't change the meaning and doesn't make it ambiguous: "She went to street WITH NOTHING ON in broad daylight and people were shocked looking at her!". Is it natural to say: "She went to street nakedly in broad daylight and people were shocked looking at her!".
<!>
Nina Michailova
No, "nakedly" is not commonly used in this sense. It can be used "obviously (and unpleasantly)". It is possible to use "naked" adverbially (or as a predicate adjective, or a appositive adjective, modifying "she"). For example: She lay on the beach, naked as the day she was born.
<!>
Preslava Ivanova
The suffix -ly is English often has similar meaning to the suffix -like, forming an adjective which means "having the same qualities as something" - for example motherly, childlike. So in the sentence "she went to the street nakedly" could mean something like "she went to the street behaving in the same way as if she was naked" but that is probably not the meaning which was intended. If she literally went out wearing no clothes, the correct adjective is "naked".

Position of "Either/Or" in the sentence
<!>
Ivan Petrov
In either ... or structure, if the two verbs are of the same type, it's easy to figure out the position of "either" and "or", for example. But if one verb is a linking verb and the other is an ordinary verb, where should either be placed?
<!>
Preslava Ivanova
A properly formed sentence with the structure either ... or conjoins two equivalent things. For example, they could be two adjectives that modify the same noun, two clauses that fill the same role in the sentence, or two nouns that are both complements of the same preposition.
