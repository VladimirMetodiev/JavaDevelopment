//Condition

//Eva has many cats in her house of various breeds, since some breeds have specific characteristics, Eva needs some way to catalogue the cats,
//help her by creating a class hierarchy with all her breeds of cats so that she can easily check on their characteristics.
//Eva has 3 specific breeds of cats "Siamese", "Cymric" and the very famous bulgarian breed "Street Extraordinaire",  each breed
//has a specific characteristic about which information should be kept. For the Siamese cats their ear size should be kept,
//for Cymric cats - the length of their fur in millimetres and for the Street Extraordinaire the decibels of their meowing during the night.
//From the console you will receive lines of cat information until the command "End" is received, the information will come in
//one of the following formats:
//>>>	"Siamese <name> <earSize>"
//>>>	"Cymric <name> <furLength>"
//>>>	"StreetExtraordinaire <name> <decibelsOfMeows>"
//On the last line after the "End" command you will receive the name of a cat, you should print that catâ€™s information
//in the same format in which you received it.
