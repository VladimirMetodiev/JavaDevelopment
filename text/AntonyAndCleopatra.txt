ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA by William Shakespeare

ACT I. SCENE I. Alexandria. A Room in CLEOPATRA's palace.

CLEOPATRA: If it be love indeed, tell me how much.
ANTONY: There's beggary in the love that can be reckon'd.
CLEOPATRA: I'll set a bourn how far to be belov'd.
ANTONY: Then must thou needs find out new heaven, new earth.
ATTENDANT: News, my good lord, from Rome.
ANTONY: Grates me: the sum.
CLEOPATRA:
Nay, hear them, Antony:
Fulvia perchance is angry; or who knows
If the scarce-bearded Caesar have not sent
His powerful mandate to you: 'Do this or this;
Take in that kingdom and enfranchise that;
Perform't, or else we damn thee.'
ANTONY: How, my love!
