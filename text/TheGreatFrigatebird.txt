The great frigatebird (Fregata minor) is a large seabird in the frigatebird family.
There are major nesting populations in the tropical Pacific (including the Galapagos Islands)
and Indian Oceans, as well as a tiny population in the South Atlantic.

The great frigatebird is a lightly built, large seabird up to 105 cm long
with predominantly black plumage. The species exhibits sexual dimorphism,
the female is larger than the adult male and has a white throat and breast,
and the male's scapular feathers have a purple-green sheen. In the breeding season,
the male is able to distend his striking red gular sac. The species feeds on fish
taken in flight from the ocean's surface (mostly flying fish), and indulges
in kleptoparasitism less frequently than other frigatebirds. They feed
in pelagic waters within 80 km (50 mi) of their breeding colony or roosting areas.
