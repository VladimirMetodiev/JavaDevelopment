The European herring gull (Larus argentatus) is a large gull, up to 66 cm (26 in) long. One of the best-known of all gulls
along the shores of Western Europe, it was once abundant. It breeds across Northern Europe, Western Europe, Central Europe,
Eastern Europe, Scandinavia, and the Baltic states. Some European herring gulls, especially those resident in colder areas,
migrate further south in winter, but many are permanent residents, e.g. in Ireland, Britain, Iceland, or on the North Sea shores.
They have a varied diet, including fish, crustaceans, as well as some plants, and are also scavengers, consuming carrion
and food left by or stolen from humans.

While herring gull numbers appear to have been harmed in recent years, possibly by fish population declines and competition,
they have proved able to survive in human-adapted areas and can often be seen in towns acting as scavengers.
